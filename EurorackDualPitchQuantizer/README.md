# EurorackDualPitchQuantizer
A simple Arduino and MCP4725 DAC based pitch quantizer. It might not be the best designed module or it might not work at all yet. I have yet to assemble a working unit or program the non test firmware for the microcontroller. I'll update this as the project goes along.
